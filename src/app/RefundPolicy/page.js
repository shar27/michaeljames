        PURCHASING A DEAL WITH US (without All Inclusive)
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl p-2">An alternative deal will be given:</p>
      <ul className="p-3">
        <li className="list-disc p-4">
          If the Vendor pulls out not due to actions of the Investor.
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc p-4">
          If the refurb quote is significantly larger than initially stated,
          provided no extras have been included by the Investor; if the Investor
          instructs searches and/or surveys, in-depth information that Michael
          James Property would not have been aware of may come to light. (This
          can potentially affect the refurb cost, valuation, and/or sale price.
          This is a rare occasion, but we must make you aware of these potential
          occurrences.) By buying a deal from us, the Investor is agreeing to
          not hold Michael James Property accountable and these revelations from
          searches and surveys may not entitle the Investor to an alternative
          deal [refund].

          If the property is genuinely down-valued and there is no course of

          If the sale continues for 9 months or more from the date the
          memorandum of sale is sent out solely due to the vendor deliberately
          slowing progress.

        <li className="list-disc p-4">
          If there are issues with the Legals of the property; terms within the
          lease prevent desired course of action, issues with title, property

          of action to resolve the matter.
