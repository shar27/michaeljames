      <p>Refund Policy Last Updated: 20/09/2023</p>

      <h2>PURCHASING A DEAL WITH US (without All Inclusive)</h2>
      <p>An alternative deal will be given:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the Vendor pulls out not due to actions of the Investor.</li>
        <li>
          If the refurb quote is significantly larger than initially stated, provided no extras have been included by the Investor; if the Investor instructs searches and/or surveys, in-depth information that Michael James Property would not have been aware of may come to light. (This can potentially affect the refurb cost, valuation, and/or sale price. This is a rare occasion, but we must make you aware of these potential occurrences.) By buying a deal from us, the Investor is agreeing to not hold Michael James Property accountable and these revelations from searches and surveys may not entitle the Investor to an alternative deal [refund].
        </li>
        <li>If the property is genuinely down-valued and there is no course of appeal action.</li>
        <li>If professional negligence by an appointed member of our power team occurs.</li>
        <li>If the rental valuation for the property is considerably less than was initially sold.</li>
        <li>If the purchase price on the original listing is wrong.</li>
        <li>
          If the sale continues for 9 months or more from the date the memorandum of sale is sent out solely due to the vendor deliberately slowing progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are issues with the Legals of the property; terms within the lease prevent desired course of action, issues with title, property not fit for use due to planning where there are no alternative courses of action to resolve the matter.
        </li>
        <li>If the tenant type differs from that which was originally sold whereby the deal does not stack as well as initially stated.</li>
      </ul>
